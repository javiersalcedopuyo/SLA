[WIP]  
A Swift library for computer graphics mathematics, based on the [Foundations of Game Engine Development](https://www.amazon.com/Eric-Lengyel/e/B001K8753Q?ref_=dbs_p_pbk_r00_abau_000000) books and DirectX, and meant to be used alongside Metal.

*NOTE: This library has the only intention to serve as a learning personal project.*
